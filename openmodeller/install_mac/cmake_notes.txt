I installed expat (and possibly other deps) from brew

brew install expat 

If you want to generate an xcode project:

ccmake -DEXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/expat/include -DEXPAT_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/expat/lib/libexpat.dylib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/openmodeller -G Xcode  ..

Or compile directly from command line:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/openmodeller
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/openmodeller/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/openmodeller -DEXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/expat/include -DEXPAT_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/expat/lib/libexpat.dylib
make -j8
make install
install_name_tool -change libopenmodeller.0.dylib /usr/local/openmodeller/lib/libopenmodeller.0.dylib /usr/local/openmodeller/bin/om_console

If you have any library reference issues, use the following command to review dependencies:

otool -L /usr/local/openmodeller/bin/om_console

and then the install_name_tool utility to fix the paths as needed
