openmodellerdesktop (1.0.7) gutsy; urgency=low

  * openModeller Library : Support changes and new features in openModeller 0.5.3
  * Options : Added user option to allow / disallow use of threading in experiment.
  * Layer Set Manager : 
  *   Let the layer count label show an appropriate value when a new layerset
      is created.
  *   Don't let the user apply a new layerset before the name field is populated.
  * Algorithm Manager :
  *   Use spinbox for float and real number inputs.
  *   Show parameter descriptions as text labels as well as tooltips.
  * Raster output :
  *   Fixes for pseudo renderer with QGIS api changes.
  *   Use QGIS lib to draw pseudocolor preview image.
  *   Scale pseudocolor to min / max based on image format min / max ranges
      and not to the range of values contained in the raster itself. Now all
      model outputs are scaled to the same value range and are more comparable.
  *   Use GDAL to write ascii grids rather than my hand carved code to do this
      - should prevent issues with running out of memory and subsequent crashing.
  * Data fetcher :
  *   Better error handling for when a data fetcher plugin cant be initialised
      (no more crash).
  *   Removed the legacy GBIF plugin - only GBIF Rest plugin will be used now.
  *   Fixed a bug where plugins were not working in windows in debug build.
  * Reports :
  *   Fix to remove artifacts from thumbnails.
  *   Fixed logic error where AUC and other stats were being set in model
      projection instead of model creation.
  *   Show cutoff threshold used for model stats.
  * Experiment designer, locality options :
  *   Added options for spatially and environmentally unique occurrence
      filtering to model class.
  * Running experiments :
  *   Delete log file before running an experiment.
  *   Fix crash when trying to view model previews while experiment is running
      (dont delete raster in omggdal because its managed by registry).
  *   Prevent a crash with zero length string for rawimage filename.
  *   Crash fix and cosmetics improvement - when clicking a not yet run model,
      show a message rather than trying to load its map even though the raster
      does not yet exist.
  * Installer :
  *   Linux: Use rpath to locate libs (where supported by host OS). This means
      you can easily install more than one copy of openModeller Desktop on
      e.g. Linux without running into issues where the wrong library gets
      used.
