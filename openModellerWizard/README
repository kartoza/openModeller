Description: This is a plugin that provides a user friendly front end to openModeller.
         openModeller is a c++ library with routines for carrying out ecological niche
         modelling (ie. predictive modelling of where species may occur).

Dependencies: At time of writing this, the oM plugin reuires openmodeller cvs head
          version to be installed. Please refer to the openmodeller.sourceforge.net
          web site for instructions on building openModeller from cvs.

Distribution specific notes:

         Mandrake: Under mandrake is installed to prefix /usr instead of /usr/local so
         you should append the following -I statements to each of the following CXXFLAGS
         sections in Makefile.am
         
         libopenmodellerplugin_la_CXXFLAGS  add :  -I/usr/include/openmodeller
         omgui_CXXFLAGS add add :  -I/usr/include/openmodeller


Installation: * Extract the archive
              * If you have installed qgis with a non default prefix, amend
              autogen.sh by adding -I /path/to/qgis.m4 dir. For example on
              my system I set my prefix to $HOME when installing qgis and
              so I adapt my aclocal path as follows:

              Before:

              aclocal \

              After:
              
              aclocal  -I /home/aps02ts/share/aclocal/ \
              
              * Run the autogen script:

              ./autogen.sh

              * Run configure, setting the prefix directive appropriately e.g.:

              ./configure

              or

              ./configure --prefix=$HOME

              * Run make  and install :

              make && make install

Post installation: Start qgis and use the plugin manager to enable the openModeller plugin.
             A new icon will be added to your toolbar, which will launch the oM gui.
